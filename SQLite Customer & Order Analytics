In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


--how many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderid)FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--how many of those orders were from an IPhone?
SELECT count(orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE product = "iPhone"; 

--select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers customers INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Febsales 
ON customers.order_id=Febsales.orderID ;

--which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

--what is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales GROUP BY product;

--which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, 
how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity), product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101" GROUP BY product;

--how many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, 
and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Febsales 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers ON Febsales.orderid = customers.order_id WHERE Febsales.Quantity>2;

--list all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%' GROUP BY Product;

--which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING)
SELECT distinct location, COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE location LIKE '%NY%' 
GROUP BY location HAVING count(orderID)>2 ;

--how many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT SUM(quantity) as quantity, product FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE product like '%Headphones%' GROUP BY Product ;

--what was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT avg(quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Febsales LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON Febsales.orderID=customers.order_ID ;

SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(customers.acctnum) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Febsales LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON Febsales.orderID=customers.order_ID ;

--what was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT avg(quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Febsales LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON Febsales.orderID=customers.order_ID ;

SELECT sum(quantity)/ count(customers.acctnum) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Febsales 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers ON Febsales.orderID=customers.order_ID ;

--which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product, sum(quantity*price) as revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc LIMIT 1 ;
